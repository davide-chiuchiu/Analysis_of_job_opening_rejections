\title{Summary report of rejection email analysis}
\author{Davide Chiuchiu}

\maketitle

\section{Scope}
This document contains my findings on the corpus of emails that I received during my job search. The email database contains 
\begin{itemize}
	\item the emails that confirmed the application submission
	\item the emails where companies showed interest in pursuing further my candidacy
	\item the emails where companies rejected my candidacy.
\end{itemize}

\section{I received more confirmation emails than rejection emails}
The first thing that I notice from this dataset is that I received more emails which confirmed the reception of my candidacy than rejection emails (see Figure \ref{fig:email_type_distribution}). This highlight that I have active review process at the moment, but also that some companies practice ghosting. Note also that only a few of the received emails corresponds to feedback. This means that I will likely need to ignore feedback emails in machine learning approaches for this analysis.

\section{Candidate feedback might suffer because rejection emails tend to be quite short.}
Candidates may not receive extensive feedback for failed submissions. Indeed, emails where candidacies have been rejected tend to be shorter than feedback emails (see Figure \ref{fig:email_lengths}). In addition, the emails which rejects a candidacy and the template emails that acknowledge a candidacy submission tend to have similar lengths. This feature suggests that emails where candidacies are rejected often corresponds to templates that leaves unsuccessful candidates without constructive feedback.
